 Visually hide an element


 When you hide an element with display: none, that prevents screen readers from reading 
 it to the user. Sometimes thatâ€™s fine, but in other cases this will make the site hard 
 to use for people with screen readers. Thus, we have to use another technique for hiding 
 lements while at the same time make them accessible.

 In this example, we are using the Sass placeholder selector since the output will always 
 be the same, which enables us to reduce repetetive code in the output.


 Usage:

 .visually-hidden {
     @extend %visuallyhidden;
 }

@define-placeholder visuallyhidden {
  margin: -1px;
  padding: 0;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  position: absolute;
}
